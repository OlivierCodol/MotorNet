    "# II. Subclassing a Task object\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go over a simple subclassing process to create a custom task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. 1. Initialization of the Task subclass\n",
    "The base class for tasks is `mn.tasks.Task`, so we will make the custom task inherit from that base class. We can then define a `__name__` for the class, and declare the losses in the `__init__` method using a `self.add_loss` method that is inherited from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that declaring losses is not mandatory for the simulation to run, but this is easier, as otherwise we would have to manually do all the things that `add_loss` does automatically for us. Also this may result in misleading (shuffled) loss labels when printing progress bars at runtime because `tensorflow` models (`tf.keras.Model`) do not maintain loss label orders properly for some reason. Adding losses to the task object will make it available to our curstom-made `tf.keras.Model` subclass, which is `mn.nets.MotorNetModel`. In `MotorNetModel` the losses available in `Task` subclasses will be re-ordered properly to avoid the parent class `tf.keras.Model` reshuffling the labels in a wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add_loss` method takes three arguments:\n",
    "- `assigned_output` should be a string matching one of the keys of the `MotorNetModel`'s output dictionary. Of note, each key corresponds to a state of the model. In its current version, `motornet` only allows one loss per output key.\n",
    "- `loss` should pass a loss object, either custom-made or from the `mn.nets.losses` module.\n",
    "- `loss_weight` is a scalar that defines the weight of the loss in the global loss that the network will optimize at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. 2. Generating inputs\n",
    "We can next define the `task.generate` method. It should take as inputs:\n",
    "- `batch_size`\n",
    "- `n_timesteps`\n",
    "\n",
    "If desired, it can also take `**kwargs` inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should produce as output a list containing three items, in the order below:\n",
    "- A dictionary containing the inputs to the network.\n",
    "- The targets that will be passed to the network (the `y`, or `y_true` in the nomenclature of the TensorFlow documentation).\n",
    "- The initial states to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. 2. a. Input dictionary\n",
    "The input dictionary only requires a \"inputs\" key. The value assigned to that key will be passed as-is as input to the network for a forward pass. So is content is essentially up to the user, according to what the user wishes the network to receive as input information. Typically, for a reaching movement, this could be the target's position in cartesian coordinates. If a delayed reach is desired, one could consider adding a go cue as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, the first dimension (rows) should always be  `batch_size` and the second dimension (columns) should always be the number of timesteps for the reach. This is true for any value in that dictionary, not just for the value associated with the \"inputs\" key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notable keys one may add are \"joint_load\" and \"endpoint_load\". These would be transmitted to the plant by the network. If one wishes to add more keys to the input dictionary, it would be required to subclass the network to implement appropriate handling of these custom-made keys in the `call` method of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility from using a dictionary as input is the reason we decided to use them. Note however that generally, `tensorflow` models can accept other forms of inputs, such as simple arrays, though our `motornet` model does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. 2. b. Targets\n",
    "The target values that the plant should produce, and that will be passed to the loss functions. In `tensorflow` nomenclature, this is sometimes referred to as the `y_true`, to which the `y_pred` is compared.\n",
    "In practice this could be the position of the target for a reaching movement. If a delayed movement is desired, it could be the starting position until the go cue time, and the target position afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. 2. c. Initial states\n",
    "The value of the initial states at simulation start. These can be obtained from the `task.get_initial_state(batch_size=batch_size)` method. If a pre-defined starting position is desired, one can pass an optional `joint_state` argument to this method as well.\n",
