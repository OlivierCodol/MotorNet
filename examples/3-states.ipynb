Since this is a 2D cartesian space, the first dimension contains two entries. For both feedback states, the last dimension is as large as the backlog, and therefore depends on the delay declared when building the `Plant`. Here, we specified a proprioceptive delay of 30 ms, and the timesteps are 10 ms, resulting in 3 timesteps. For vision, the delay is 90 ms, resulting in 9 timesteps.\n",
