# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

import sys

# Workaround for issue https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/googleanalytics/issues/2
# Note that a warning still will be issued "unsupported object from its setup() function"
# Remove this workaround when the issue has been resolved upstream
